# G07

## Overview

This repository contains the projects for G07, which focus on distributed systems. Each module in the repository demonstrates key concepts in distributed computing, implemented through various frameworks and protocols.

### Modules

1. **MP1: Distributed Log Grep (log-grep)**
   - Implements a distributed logging system for generating and aggregating logs across multiple nodes.
   - Demonstrates fault tolerance and scalability.

2. **MP2: Fault Detector using SWIM Protocol**
   - Implements a fault detection mechanism inspired by the SWIM (Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection-style Membership) protocol.
   - Ensures high availability and robust failure detection in distributed systems.

3. **MP3: Distributed File Storage (Hadoop-inspired)**
   - Implements a distributed file storage system inspired by Hadoop's architecture.
   - Supports file splitting, replication, and distributed access.

4. **MP4: Streaming Service (Spark-inspired)**
   - Implements a streaming data processing system inspired by Apache Spark.
   - Supports real-time computation on data streams.
